                <img src="img2.jpg" width="430" height="300">
                <p>It tells the story of four Isekai heroes-wielding the sword,spear,bow and shield-who defended the
                    land from wave after wave
                    of calamity.With the fate of the world in balance,the kingdom of Melromarc summons these legendary
                    figures;in modern-day Japan
                    ,the call is answered,and the unwitting heroes are transported to this fantasy universe.<br>
                    Thrust into Melromarc and given the title of "Shield Hero," otaku Naofumi Iwatani is labeled the
                    weakest due to his lack of offensive
                    capability and apparent inexperience. When the heroes part ways to start their journeys, he only has
                    one willing companion:
                    the beautiful princess Malty Melromarc. However, she soon betrays him, steals all his money, and
                    accuses him of taking advantage of
                    her.<br>
                    For his alleged crimes, Naofumi is branded a criminal and made outcast of society. With hatred
                    filling his heart, he sets out
                    alone, vowing vengeance against those who wronged him.

                <img src="img5.jpg" width="430" height="300">
                <p>
                    Thirty-seven-year-old Satoru Mikami is a typical corporate worker, who is perfectly content with
                    his
                    monotonous lifestyle in Tokyo, other than failing to nail down a girlfriend even once throughout
                    his life.
                    In the midst of a casual encounter with his colleague, he falls victim to a random assailant on
                    the streets
                    and is stabbed. However, while succumbing to his injuries, a peculiar voice echoes in his mind,
                    and recites a
                    bunch of commands which the dying man cannot make sense of.<br>

                    When Satoru regains consciousness, he discovers that he has reincarnated as a goop of slime in
                    an
                    unfamiliar realm. In doing so, he acquires newfound skillsâ€”notably, the power to devour anything
                    and
                    mimic its appearance and abilities. He then stumbles upon the sealed Catastrophe-level
                    monster "Storm Dragon" Verudora who had been sealed away for the past 300 years for devastating
                    a town to ashes. Sympathetic to his predicament, Satoru befriends him, promising to assist in
                    destroying the seal. In return, Verudora bestows upon him the name Rimuru Tempest to grant
                    him divine protection. <br>

                    Now, liberated from the mundanities of his past life, Rimuru embarks on a fresh journey with a
                    distinct goal in mind. As he grows accustomed to his new physique, his gooey antics ripple
                    throughout the world, gradually altering his fate.<br>
